# My personal journalling app

#### In short . . .
This app asks a couple of essential questions everyday, lets you to create daily or scheduled tasks and then creates posts on 

1. Evernote - for later record.
2. Desktop wallpaper - so that it's the first thing you see when you start you pc.

It also has trackers for meditation, exercise, birthdays etc. 

## Intro: My need for a personlised productivity app.
I have tried a lot of productivity apps. Mostly on android. They are diverse and beatiful. They have different specialisations like meditation tracking, habit tracking, exercise, daily todo etc. But everything boils down to this:
### Story
1. You download an app. It says you have to take some particular actions and then helps you schedule some milestone to reach some arbitrary goals.
2. You try it first day and complete the tasks, and get 3 badges, 10 stars and a ballon which suggests you to share this achievement with your friends on social media.
3. Depending on how free you are you follow the routines until you don't.
4. The next day (or some other _next_ day after _step 3_) you don't feel like it and skip it.
5. After several days you are reminded of the app somehow, but when you open it, there are graphs and other visuals which show some activity for 5 days and then nothing. 
6. It basically shows you what a **complete failure** you are on which point you uninstall the app. 
7. This cycle repeats everytime you get an epiphany after going down the **"success"** rabbit hole on youtube or just your own thoughts when you are sleep deprived, on coffee or alchohol.
### Analysis of the story
1. Most of the time, an app is downloaded with a purpose of taking back control of life.
	1. It is natural to think that logging your progress is beneficial. And a helpful app can streamline this process and maybe provide some *"optimised"*,*"scientific"* ways to help in that process.
	1. You think maybe, just maybe, if you get the *right* algorithm/app, you would complete all the tasks assigned, reach the goals and your life would be changed for ever.

And this is **Problem number 1: No responsibility**. We can't offload *taking back our life* to an app. There are some benifits to logging though, but it must be done conciously.

2. Yo what's up with giving medals for participation. It makes no sense, all it does is diminish the value of the medals. 
3. The keyword here is *free*, you don't try to hustle, the app alarm goes off, if you are free and it is taking no extra effort at all, you do the task. And if and whenever you meet an obstacle, you quit.
There is a flip side to this though, if you design your enviroment such that, there are no obstacles which hinder you to just *start* your task. Most of the time you don't quit in between doing the task. Eg:
	1. Uninstalling all social media and youtube and installing addons on browser which block particular websites.
	1. Autostart the apps on your desktop which are related to your task.
	1. Declutter your desk, keep snacks and water handy when sitting for a session.
See all this designing must be done by you and not by some app.
4. Strangely, this time the lack of those worthless medals does affect you. 
This brings us to **Problem number 2: Procastination**. Consider this situation: `you are watching an hour long video on youtube and it's not that interesting, you check your phone and nothing is there, you open youtube homepage and nothing. For a moment thoughts cross your mind "should I work on that task", you even open the required folders and files but you just can't put your mind to focus on it. ` this was a difficult edge cast but most of the time you are just doing something which is more simulating than tedious work.
