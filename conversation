how do start... what do I focus on... OK. let's see. My journalling app.... I have told so many people about it: mama, ashwin, mayank, aniket. I don't know if its good or not. 
Ok... what to do now ? ?
Lets design the output photo... It should have:
    Distraction list
    Today's TODO
    Quote
    Graph about meditation, exercise, sleep and food.
        Meditation: {x: day, y: min_meditated}
        Exercise: Use a bar graph in which the bar is multicolored. Each colour                    representing areas  Legs, Back, Chest,...
        Sleep: Colour code the bars which are utilized for sleeping(optional: meditating, exercise,... if it does not look too much congested)

TEXTURE
Also, make the line ending round.

I want to make a class which filters the attributes based on their types.
Puts them into respective lists 
Then change their repr (or type); input and output.
So that the code is more readable while viewing yaml file.
The subclass would have two _______. One for taking in and other for giving out


--Making a task list / Reading the database--------------
task_list = --list of tasks--
There will a function or class which looks on today's entry.
And sees if there is any scheduled task from previous dates, creates a task list from previous day's distraction list. 
#Case 1: previous day task
The method, goes to the previous date, reads
    - task string, 

#Case 2: from_task_string DONE !!!

testcases
    1. If a new task is made the day.day  is 1 
        len(days) == 1 and days[0].day == 1
    2. If a new task is made and no day  is given,
len(days) == 1 and days[0].day == 1
    3. If days already extit


--Writing on the database------------
# Case 1.1 First time task, only morning input taken.
    In this case, I only have estd_time and notes.
    But how to verify that this is the case ?
# Case 1.2
    First time taks, evening input also taken.
# Case 2 Task not completed and scheduled for a particular date.
When scheduling for the next date, write
    Task string, previous date, 
    
     
    

    First coffee, then that, then figure out .from_db class method.
