how do start... what do I focus on... OK. let's see. My journalling app.... I have told so many people about it: mama, ashwin, mayank, aniket. I don't know if its good or not. 
Ok... what to do now ? ?
Lets design the output photo... It should have:
    Distraction list
    Today's TODO
    Quote
    Graph about meditation, exercise, sleep and food.
        Meditation: {x: day, y: min_meditated}
        Exercise: Use a bar graph in which the bar is multicolored. Each colour                    representing areas  Legs, Back, Chest,...
        Sleep: Colour code the bars which are utilized for sleeping(optional: meditating, exercise,... if it does not look too much congested)

TEXTURE
Also, make the line ending round.

I want to make a class which filters the attributes based on their types.
Puts them into respective lists 
Then change their repr (or type); input and output.
So that the code is more readable while viewing yaml file.
The subclass would have two _______. One for taking in and other for giving out


--Making a task list / Reading the database--------------
task_list = --list of tasks--
There will a function or class which looks on today's entry.
And sees if there is any scheduled task from previous dates, creates a task list from previous day's distraction list. 
#Case 1: same day evening task (default = today)
The method, goes to the morning of same date and
    1. Set line of date = 3
 
class Database(object):
    tasks = []

class Database(object):
    tasks = []
    2. x is no of characters from margin, y is line no 
    3. find and save the date_line_no of next date = 40
    4. our playground is now [0, 37] lines
    5. for 0 <= x <= 4 and 0 <= y <= 37 search for 'Tasks'
    6. Repeat 1 for line at 'Tasks'
    7. Repeat 3 = 40
    8. Repeat 4 [0,17]
    9. Repeat 5 - 0<=x<=1, 0<=y<=17 make a dict of line_number:task_number
    10. for each line_number in 0,17,
        day.completed : [3,0 - 7,0]    <---- position in rel. x,y
        task_string : [13,0 - EOL]
        day.day : [8,1]
        estd_time : . . .
        


--Writing on the database------------
# Case 1.1 First time task, only morning input taken.
    In this case, I only have estd_time and notes.
    But how to verify that this is the case ?
# Case 1.2
    First time taks, evening input also taken.
# Case 2 Task not completed and scheduled for a particular date.
When scheduling for the next date, write
    Task string, previous date, 
    
    
    
    
I need to make a database class which can seek through the database and point to particular strings from where methods from the Task module can act on it. 
pointing to lines vs extracting information from them
what is seeker object doing ? 


What are monthly leetcode challenges ?

Search if employers check hackerank rank, also is there a similar system in LC.
